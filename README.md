The overall goal of this repository is not just to "showcase" my solutions, but more to have the associated commentary. I feel the content of these coding exercises is less about the final product and more about your process for determining which way to solve the problem, which data structure to use, how your algorithm can be optimized, and each of these things often includes steps that don't make it to, or are not tranparent in the final code.
