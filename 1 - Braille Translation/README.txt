I didn't save the description text for my version of this problem (instructions/coding challenges are destroyed upon completion), so I copied a version from somebody that did this a while ago. I don't remember my version being as explicit in the beginning as to how to do the encoding. In particular, I don't remember the text telling you they were doing the encoding from Braille to binary as reading the dots top-to-bottom, left-to-right (as opposed to the left-to-right, top-to-bottom convention used on the wikipedia page for 'Braille ASCII'), and I don't remember it mentioning anything explicitly about spaces or how to do capitalization. But in any case, this was relatively straight-forward.
