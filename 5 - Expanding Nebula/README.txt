This is the second challenge where I've been tripped up by trying to generate all solutions rather than just coming up with a method to give a count of number of solutions. Probably because when coding up something for inclusion into SageMath ( http://sagemath.org/ ), having an iterator to generate all possible objects is mandatory/more important, and having a cardinality method (other than the default of ``list them all using the iterator and count them'') is optional.

This is a cellular automata problem where you're told how the system behaves after one time step, and you need to count how many things are in the pre-image of a given state. First inclination was to take a dynamic programming approach with backtracking. Start with an empty "potential pre-image", and have the loop keep calling itself with all the ways you could potentially add True/False into an entry that hadn't been filled yet. Along the way, you check that everytime you add a box that completes a contiguous 2x2 block, that the number of Trues in that 2x2 block corresponds with the True/False value in the corresponding entry of the given input. Ie, say you had [[True,False],[False,X]] , and you were trying to fill in the X. If your input was [[True]], then X would have to be False (so that 2x2 block had precisely on True). If your input was False, then X would have to be True (so that the 2x2 block did not have exactly one True in it).

I quickly managed to get code that worked for all but the last 2 test cases, which I've gathered are the larger test cases. I spent a lot of time thinking that I just needed to optimize my existing code. In retrospect, I maybe should have looked at the caveat about test cases having solutions up to 10^9 and recognizing that it was too high to be something that should be enumerated one at a time.

One minor optimization I decided wasn't worth the effort of pursuing was actually building up a potential preimage from a 0x0 array, and not just starting with an array that had the desired dimensions filled with None. Lots of messing around with indices, special cases for when you're adding something to start a new row. It didn't seem like it would save a lot of time, and certainly wasn't going to be a bottleneck. 

Lots of my focus was on trying to figure out the best way to try and fill up a potential pre-image. For example, if you just go in a standard way across rows/down columns, then you never actually complete a 2x2 block that triggers a check that might allow you to break the loop and backtrack until the second row. So first I determined that if anything we would want to do columns first, then across rows (as the columns had a much lower upper bound). I also decided that if instead of going straight down the first column, I did "row 1 column 1, row 1 column 2, row 2 column 1, row 2 column 2, etc." and zig-zagged down the first two columns, I would be introducing checks to introduce backtracks sooner. I even went as far as trying out filling the pre-image along anti-diagonals, to further maximize how soon you introduce backtrack options. It leads to a potentially interesting question of what is the 'optimal' way to ennumerate lattice points in a rectangle with respect to completing 2x2 squares as soon as possible. One could weight an enumeration by adding 'k' to the weight when the kth lattice point in the enumeration completes a 2x2 square, and look for an enumeration of minimal weight.

These minor optimizations were enough to get the penultimate test to pass, but not the last one. One thing I had thought about was that the loop only forces you to backtrack when the corresponding entry in the input is True, requiring the 2x2 block in your preimage to have exactly one True in it. In this case, there is at most 1, and potentially 0 options for how to fill in the block. If the corresponding entry in the input is False, then you just need there to not be exactly one True, and there will always be either 1 or 2 ways to accomplish this. So my thought was that instead of always filling out potential pre-images in the same order, you needed to pre-process the input in order to guide the way you filled out a potential pre-image to reach the backtrack conditions as soon as possible.

Eventually, my thought process moved more towards thinking if there was a more clever way to just do enumeration, or if it was possible to tack on entire columns at once and have things speed up. The key insight was that once you tack on a right-most column to a potential pre-image, you don't particularly need to know what exists in the previous columns, you just need to know how many potential pre-images have that specified final column. Then it began to make more sense why the dimensions were restricted in one direction. If columns are at most length 9, at most 2^9=512 column vectors, only 2^18 = 262144 pairs of columns vectors when you want to check if one column vector can be tacked on to an existing right-most column vector.

So for final execution, I decided I was going to make a dictionary whose keys were tuples representing the (at most) 2^9 possible column vectors for our pre-image. The value would be a list where the ith entry specified how many potential pre-images with i columns filled in had that key as its final column, initialized with a 1 for the first entry. For the loop, on the kth step, you take every possible final column X, every possible column Y you could tack on, see if the nx2 concatenation of them is compatible with the kth column of the input matrix. If it is, then you add the kth entry in the value for X to the (k+1)st entry of Y. Once you reach the end and you have how many filled out potential pre-images have each column vector as it's final column, you add up the last entry in all the values.

This method was actually very similar to something I had used before in pure mathematics. I'll skip explanations of terminology for brevity, but when you want to compute the number of maximal chains in a partially ordered set, you think about computing the number of saturated chains from a minimal element up to a given element by recursively saying 'the number of saturated chains from a minimal element up to a given element is the sum of those values for all elements it covers', and initializing with the value of all minimal elements to be 1. At the end, you just add up the values for all maximal elements. In an obtuse way, you could phrase the given problem in that terminology. Elements of the poset are tuples of column vectors and an integer indicating poset rank/which index you're thinking of that column as being in, running over all pairs of column vectors and checking compatibility with input matrix is finding cover relations.

One very useful application of this was for computing the number of linear extensions of a partially ordered set. Default method in Sage was to iterate over all linear extensions and count them. An alternate way is to think of linear extensions as being maximal chains in the lattice of order ideals. There's some additional work in terms of needing to construct the lattice of order ideals (most of the work on that implementation was efficiently constructing the lattice of order ideals), but it is generally orders of magnitude faster.
